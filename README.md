# COVID-19 EDA Analysis
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data sourced from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/). The goal is to analyze and visualize the pandemic's impact across different regions and time periods, providing valuable insights into the spread and recovery trends.

## Objectives
-  Analyze global and regional COVID-19 case distributions, recoveries, and fatalities.
-  Identify significant trends and correlations in the data.
-  Visualize key insights through informative and interactive plots.
-  Demonstrate data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning and transformation.
## Data Source
The datasets used in this project are retrieved from the official [WHO COVID-19 Dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c), ensuring credibility and accuracy.

## Tools and Libraries
This project uses Python and the following libraries:

1.  **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations.
2.  **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
3.  **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static and detailed visualizations.
4.  **Plotly (Express & Graph Objects)**:* For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
5.  **Folium**: For creating interactive maps to visualize geographical data.
6.  **Ipywidgets (Interact)**: For creating interactive widgets to enhance data exploration.
7.  **Warnings**: Suppressed warnings to improve readability in the notebook.
8.  **Google Colab**: Allows easy collaboration, integration with Google Drive, and ensures that the project can be accessed and executed from anywhere without the need for local installations.
These tools work together to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data, offering detailed insights into the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Features
1.  Data Preprocessing:
-  Handle missing or inconsistent data.
-  Convert raw datasets into clean, structured formats suitable for analysis.

2.  Exploratory Analysis:
-  Temporal analysis of cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time.
-  Geographical trends by country and region.
-  Identifying factors like recovery rates and fatality trends.

3.  Data Visualization:
-  Generate line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive visualizations.
-  Showcase trends in cases, recoveries, and deaths for better comprehension.

## Results
This analysis uncovers:

Patterns in the spread of COVID-19 across different countries and timeframes.
Recovery and fatality trends by region.
Correlations between various factors influencing the pandemic.
